# Alan wrote the following method, which was intended to show all of the factors of the input number.
#Alyssa noticed that this will fail if the input is `0`, or a negative number, and asked Alan to change the loop.
#How can you make this work without using `begin`/`end`/`until`?
#Note that we're not looking to find the factors for 0 or negative numbers, but we just want to handle it gracefully instead of
#raising an exception or going into an infinite loop.

  divisor = number

  while divisor > 0 do
    factors << number / divisor if number % divisor == 0
    divisor -= 1
  end
