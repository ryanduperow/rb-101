# Write a method that takes two arguments: the first is the starting number, 
# and the second is the ending number. Print out all numbers between the two 
# numbers, except if a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz", if a number is 
# divisible by 5, print "Buzz", and finally if a number is divisible by 3 and 
# 5, print "FizzBuzz".
